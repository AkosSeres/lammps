This directory contains links to the NWChem PWDFT library which is
required to use the NWCHEM package and its fix nwchem command in a
LAMMPS input script.

The PWDFT library is available at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++ and was
developed by Eric Bylaska (PNNL).

You can type "make lib-nwchem" from the src directory to see help on
how to download and build this library via make commands, or you can
do the same thing by typing "python Install.py" from within this
directory, or you can do it manually by following the instructions
below.

-----------------

Instructions:

1.  Download PWDFT at GitHub URL ...
    either as a tarball or via SVN, and unpack the
    tarball either in this /lib/voronoi directory
    or somewhere else on your system.

2.  Compile PWDFT from within its home directory
    % make

3.  There is no need to install PWDFT on your system if you only wish
    to use it from LAMMPS.  You can install it if you wish to use it
    stand-alone or from other codes:
    a) install under the default /usr/local
       % sudo make install
    b) install under a user-writeable location by first
         changing the PREFIX variable in the config.mk file, then
       % make install

4.  Create a soft link in this dir (lib/nwchem)
    to the PWDFT build_library directory.  E.g if you built PWDFT in this dir:
      % ln -s PWDFT/build_library liblink
    This link could instead be set to the lib
    directories created by a build of PWDFT elsewher on your system, e.g.
      % ln -s /user/sjplimp/nwchem/PWDFT/build_library liblink

-----------------

When these steps are complete you can build LAMMPS
with the NWCHEM package installed:

% cd lammps/src
% make yes-nwchem
% make g++ (or whatever target you wish)

Note that if you download and unpack a new LAMMPS tarball, the
"includelink" and "liblink" files will be lost and you will need to
re-create them (step 4).  If you built PWDFT in this directory (as
opposed to somewhere else on your system) and did not install it
somewhere else, you will also need to repeat steps 1,2,3.

The Makefile.lammps file in this directory is there for compatibility
with the way other libraries under the lib dir are linked with by
LAMMPS.  However, PWDFT requires no auxiliary files or settings, so
its variables are blank.
