This package provides a fix nwchem command which is a wrapper on the
NWChem quantum code, so that molecular dynamics can be run with LAMMPS
using DFT forces.  Or QM/MM ...

Using this package requires the LATTE code to first be downloaded and
built as a library on your system.  This can be done in lib/latte or
elsewhere on your system.  Details of the download and build process
for LATTE are given in the lib/latte/README file and it can also be
done via the make lib-latte command from the LAMMPS src directory.

Once you have successfully built LAMMPS with this package and the
LATTE library you can test it using an input file from the examples
latte dir, e.g.

lmp_serial -in lammps/examples/latte/in.latte.water

This pair style was written in collaboration with the LATTE
developers.
