The NWCHEM package enables LAMMPS to wrap the NWChem quantum code,
specifically its PWDFT library for plane-wave electronic structure
calculations.  With the fix nwchem command, either AIMD or QM/MM
calculations can be done using quantum forces and energy computed by
NWChem.

The NWChem PWDFT library is available to GitHub URL.  It was developed
by Eric Bylaska (PNNL), one of the NWChem developers.

That library can be downloaded and built in lib/nwchem or elsewhere on
your system, which must be done before building LAMMPS with this
package.  Details of the download, build, and install process for
PWDFT are given in the lib/nwchem/README file, and scripts are
provided to help automate the process.  Also see the LAMMPS manual for
general information on building LAMMPS with external libraries.  The
settings in the Makefile.lammps file in lib/nwchem must be correct for
LAMMPS to build correctly with this package installed.

Once you have successfully built LAMMPS with this package and NWChem
PWDFT, you can test it using one or more of the input files from the
examples dir:

mpirun -np 4 ./lmp_mpi < lammps/examples/nwchem/in.charges.pbc.aimd
